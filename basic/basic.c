/*
 * basic.c -- illustrate basic load/store operations on PM
 *
 * usage: basic [-FMRVd] [-i icount] path [strings...]
 *
 * 	Where <path> is a file on a Persistent Memory aware file system
 * 	like PMFS.  If path doesn't exist, this program will create it
 * 	with size DEFAULT_SIZE (defined below).
 *
 * 	Any strings provided will be written to the Persistent Memory,
 * 	each terminated by a '\0' character.  If no strings are
 * 	provided, the Persistent Memory is dumped out in a manner similar
 * 	to strings(1).
 *
 * 	The -F flag enables the fault injection testing version of libpmem.
 * 	This for more meaningful icount-based runs (see the -i flag below).
 *
 * 	The -M flag enables the msync-based version of libpmem.
 * 	Use this when you don't have a PM-aware file system and you're
 * 	running on traditional memory-mapped files instead.
 *
 *  The -R flag enables the multi-range version of pmem_persist.
 *  Use this when you want to persist multiple dirty regions
 *  together.
 *
 *  The -V flag enables the multi-range version of pmem_persist with verify.
 *  Use this when you want to persist multiple dirty regions
 *  together with Posix synchronized I/O data integrity completion.
 *
 * 	The -d flag turns on debugging prints.
 *
 * 	The -i flag, if given, turns on instruction counting for the
 * 	code snippet under test (the code between icount_start() and
 *	icount_stop() below).  Use "-i 0" to print the count, "-i N"
 *	to simulate a crash after N instructions.  For more accurate
 *	fault injection testing, use this with the -F flag described above.
