NAME
	Linux Persistent Memory Application Programming Interface

SYNOPSIS
	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <sys/mman.h>
	#include <sys/stat.h>
	#include <fcntl.h>
	#include <pmem.h>
	cc ... -lpmem

	/* open a Persistent Memory file */
	fd = open("/path/to/pm-aware-filesystem/file", O_RDWR);

	/* map it */
	base = mmap(NULL, len, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);

	/* optional, instead of mmap line above: */
	base = pmem_map(fd, len);

	/* ... use loads and stores to access PM at *base ... */

	/* make changes persistent */
	msync(addr, nbytes, MS_SYNC);

	/* optional, instead of mmap line above: */
	pmem_persist(addr, nbytes, 0);

	/* other interfaces described in this document... */
	pmem_flush_cache(addr, len, flags);
	pmem_fence();
	pmem_drain_pm_stores();

	/* and many other POSIX file APIs... */

	NOTE: If libpmem has not been installed on this system, you'll
	      want to arrange for "pmem.h" to be included via a non-system
	      path, and you'll want to arrange to either find libpmem to be
	      using LD_LIBRARY_PATH or use the static version, libpmem.a.

DESCRIPTION

	This document describes the Linux API for accessing Persistent
	Memory (PM).  The Linux Persistent Memory API follows the
	"NVM.PM.FILE" programming model as described in the NVM Programming
	Model Specification published by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical
	Work Group (except as noted in the TODO section below).  See
	http://www.snia.org/ for more information.

	The prerequisites to using this API are to install some Persistent
	Memory in your system and then expose that Persistent Memory using
	the appropriate device driver and a PM-aware file system such as PMFS
	(for more information on PMFS, see https://github.com/linux-pmfs).
	Of course, it is possible to develop code using these APIs without
	having actual Persistent Memory hardware available, for example by
	using volatile DRAM as "pretend" Persistent Memory.  All the APIs
	below will work, but things like power failure testing will not be
	available during development.

	POSIX file APIs

		The PM-aware file system exposes Persistent Memory as
		files, so POSIX file APIs work as expected.  This includes
		the obvious basic operations, such as:

			open(2)
			close(2)
			read(2)
			write(2)
			fsync(2)
			mmap(2)
			msync(2)

		and typically includes the most common operations for
		managing files, such as:

			chmod(2)
			chown(2)
			closedir(3)
			creat(2)
			lseek(2)
			madvise(2)
			mkdir(2)
			mprotect(2)
			opendir(3)
			readdir(3)
			readlink(2)
			rename(2)
			rmdir(2)
			symlink(2)
			utimes(2)
			... and many more ...

		In fact, most C library calls designed to operate on files
		will work with Persistent Memory just like they work with
		other file systems.  Like any file system, a PM-aware file
		system may or may not implement all possible interfaces,
		returning "Not supported" for some of them.

		Another aspect of a PM-aware file system is that Persistent
		Memory files can be managed using common command-line
		utilities like cp, mv, ls, and tar.

	int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);

		To begin accessing Persistent Memory, open(2) is used
		just as it would be for any other file.  The open mode
		specifies whether the file is opened read-only (O_RDONLY),
		for read/write (O_RDWR), etc.  See the open(2) man page
		for details.  

	void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
	           int fd, off_t offset);

		The next step to using Persistent Memory is to map it
		into the address space of the process using mmap(2).
		For Persistent Memory, the flag MAP_SHARED is most
		commonly used, providing the application with direct
		access to the Persistent Memory.  For traditional files,
		using mmap this way will "demand-page" data in and out
		of the system page cache as it is accessed.  This results
		in unpredictable latencies, much longer when page faults
		happen to occur.  But with Persistent Memory, the page cache
		is avoided, providing direct, uniform access to the memory
		itself.
		
		The flag MAP_PRIVATE may be used, in which case reads will
		come directly from Persistent Memory until a page is written
		for the first time.  At that point, a copy-on-write will
		happen and the modified page will be located in volatile DRAM.
		MAP_PRIVATE pages are never written back to Persistent Memory
		and are discarded when the process calls munmap(2) or it
		exits.

		See the man page mmap(2) for details on this interface.

	void *pmem_map(int fd, size_t len);

		This function is just a convenience function that calls
		mmap(2) with the appropriate arguments.  It is entirely
		programmer preference on whether you use this function or
		call mmap directly.  Returns NULL with errno set on failure.

	int msync(void *addr, size_t length, int flags);

		Force any changes in the range [addr, addr+len) to be stored
		durably in Persistent Memory.  POSIX specifies (and Linux
		enforces) that addr must be page-aligned, which may force
		the call to flush more data than required.  See pmem_persist()
		below for an alternate solution.  Note that the traditional
		definition of msync is to search the "page cache" for dirty
		pages.  But for Persistent Memory, the page cache is not
		involved and msync's effect is more related to flushing dirty
		data from the processor's cache and other HW buffers to make
		sure it is fully persistent.

		WARNING: The semantics of msync(2) have always been to
		         check for unwritten changes and write them out.
			 Nothing prevents changes from being written out
			 before msync is called and no atomic or transactional
			 behavior is implied by the msync call.  It is a
			 "flush" operation to catch anything that hasn't
			 been flushed already.

		See the man page msync(2), and the related pages mprotect(2)
		and madvise(2) for more information.

	void pmem_persist(void *addr, size_t len, int flags);

		Force any changes in the range [addr, addr+len) to be stored
		durably in Persistent Memory.  This is equivalent to calling
		msync(2) as described above, but may be more optimal and will
		avoid calling into the kernel if possible.

		No flags have been defined for this call yet.

		WARNING: Like msync(2) described above, there is nothing
		         atomic or transactional about this call.  Any
			 unwritten stores in the given range will be written,
			 but some stores may have already been written by
			 virtue of normal cache eviction/replacement policies.
			 Correctly written code must not depend on stores
			 waiting until pmem_persist() is called to become
			 persistent -- they can become persistent at any time
			 before pmem_persist() is called.

	void pmem_flush_cache(void *addr, size_t len, int flags);
	void pmem_fence(void);
	void pmem_drain_pm_stores(void);

		These three functions provide partial versions of the
		pmem_persist() function described above.  pmem_persist()
		can be thought of as this:

		void pmem_persist(void *addr, size_t len, int flags)
		{
			/* flush the processor caches */
			pmem_flush_cache(addr, len, flags);

			/* Persistent Memory store barrier */
			pmem_fence();

			/* wait for any PM stores to drain from HW buffers */
			pmem_drain_pm_stores();
		}

		These functions allow advanced programs to create their
		own variations of pmem_persist().  For example, a program
		that needs to flush several discontiguous ranges can call
		pmem_flush_cache() for each range and then follow up by
		calling the pmem_fence() and pmem_drain_pm_stores() once.
